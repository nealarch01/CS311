For HW7 EC which is one of the EC2:

  Study my detectCycle.txt   (the correct output minus
  displaying the stack each time)

  Modify your hw7client.cpp to do the same
  but be sure to
  ** still display the stack as you did in HW7. PLEASE!! **

  I think you will need in hw7client.cpp:
  - a vector called Path
  - a function to check to see if a vertex
    is already in Path
  - a function to display the Path

*  You need to add to Path as you move forward
*  You need to remove from Path as you backup to
   a parent node.  The challenge is in figuring out
   when you are backing up. This can be done all
   within hw7client.cpp without changing other files.
