  New searh2 in slist
  
  Make a copy of search and 

  el_t search2(el_t X)
  { el_t M; // blank
    X has only the ID part set.
    In the slist look for matching el_t in Elem (the same code as search)
    Return the el_t obj or if not found
    return a blank object M }

  This way search2 should work with your HW3P2 as well.
